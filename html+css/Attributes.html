<!--'src' in the <img> tag is an attribute
href is also an attribute
In container tags, attributes always go in the opening tag

- You could use 'alt' to add image descriptions:
<img src="img_boy.jpg"
alt="Boy in a hat"
- The alt attribute can be:
        read aloud by sreen readers
        shown when image doesn't load
        read by search engines
        
    hence, makes your page more accessible
    
- width is an optional attribute-->

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Phone</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="phone.jpg" width="300" height="200">
    </body>
</html>
